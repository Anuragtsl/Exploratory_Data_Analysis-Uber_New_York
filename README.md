# Exploratory_Data_Analysis-Uber_New_York

### ***As this Notebook is of size > 25MB. So, I have uploaded it in .rar format, just download and unzip it for use!***

I have done Data Analysis on Uber-pickups-New_York dataset.

In this I've used Python’s [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/getting-started/#:~:text=Plotly%20for%20Python.-,Overview,3%2Ddimensional%20use%2Dcases.), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [Numpy](https://numpy.org/), [Folium](http://python-visualization.github.io/folium/), etc for analysis.

I've used [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) for coding!

I obtained the [Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/fivethirtyeight/uber-pickups-in-new-york-city). 

It consists of data on over 4.5 million Uber pickups in New York City from April to September 2014, and 14.3 million more Uber pickups from January to June 2015 from the NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC). 

**For this project, I’ll be using the data from April to September 2014, and Januray to June 2015.(Total 8 datasets)**

***You can follow along the Jupyter Notebook for more!***

# Looking At The Big Picture

**There are a ton of questions this dataset can be used to answer here's some of the following:**
* Uber pickup and distribution in NYC
* Time when Uber pickup happens regularly
* Days when Pickup happen regularly
* Pickup distribution in the Zones
* Pickup distribution on the map, and finding out the highly clustered/hotspot areas.

# Conclusion

***Hope you liked my project on Uber_pickups_New-York Data analysis and Visualization using Python. I have done brief analysis of these data sets and had comeup with some Real-World solutions.***

#Njoy!
